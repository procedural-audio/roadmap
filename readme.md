# Roadmap

This repository is the home for the metasampler roadmap. 

### Version 0.0

This version will focus on getting all the essential core functions working. This includes multi-voice processing of audio, midi, and control signals, as well as integration with faust, a mostly implemented frontend, state management, state saving/loading, and verification that it works cross platform and as a VST. 

### Version 0.2

This version will focus on implementing the most important modules, to include a sample player and sampler module. It will also integrate LUA scripting for both event processing and the user interface. It will also include the Faust JIT module, and some prototypes for basic UI animations. 

### Version 0.6

This version is focused on implementing as many DSP modules as possible. I will also start working on the website, including the login, file uploading/downloading, and start planning license verification. I will also work on creating some graph animations. 

### Version 0.8

In this version I will implement all but the most difficult modules. I will also finish the license verification. 

### Version 1.0

In this version I will integrate machine learning functionality and create a tone transfer module.
